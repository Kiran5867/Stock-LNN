Also try to predict the standard deviation of the temperature sequence, or some measure of variation.

LTCs in parallel? one LTC for each tau, each receives the input. 
Then the output of each LTC is fed into another LTC, of some special tau (experiment with taus, yes)
Instead of just LTCs in sequences, which didn't even work in shilong's experiment according to the output.
